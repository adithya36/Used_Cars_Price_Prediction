# Used Cars Price Prediction

### Introduction
Determining the selling price of a used car is a challenging task, due to the many factors 
that drive its price in the market. Several factors, including mileage, make, model, colour, 
year, etc. can influence the actual worth of a car. In addition to deciding whether a used 
car is worth its listed price, it can also be difficult from the perspective of a seller to 
price a used car appropriately.

### Goal
The goal of this project is to develop machine learning models that can accurately predict 
the price of a used car based on its features. We train and evaluate various machine 
learning models on a dataset that contains prices for a wide variety of makes and models 
across four nations.

### Dataset
This project uses the data on used car sales from four countries namely Belarus, Germany, 
India, the United States available on Kaggle. The features of the final merged dataset are 
Manufacturer name, Gear (Transmission type), Odometer (km), Year of manufacture, Fuel, 
Country, Price ($).
